# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security policies and best practices implemented across all Azure Terraform modules in this repository. Our modules follow a "security-by-default" approach, ensuring that resources are deployed with the most secure configuration possible while maintaining functionality.

## Security Principles

### 1. **Defense in Depth**
- Multiple layers of security controls
- No single point of failure
- Complementary security measures

### 2. **Least Privilege**
- Minimal permissions by default
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Service principals with scoped permissions

### 3. **Zero Trust**
- Never trust, always verify
- Assume breach mentality
- Continuous validation

### 4. **Security by Default**
- Secure configurations out of the box
- Opt-in for less secure options
- Clear documentation for security implications

## Compliance Standards

Our modules are designed to help meet the following compliance standards:

### SOC 2 Type II
- **Access Controls**: Private endpoints, RBAC, MFA
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring**: Diagnostic settings, audit logs
- **Availability**: High availability configurations

### ISO 27001
- **Information Security Management**: Systematic approach to managing sensitive data
- **Risk Assessment**: Threat protection and vulnerability management
- **Access Control**: Identity and access management
- **Cryptography**: Strong encryption standards

### GDPR
- **Data Protection**: Encryption and access controls
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging
- **Data Locality**: Region-specific deployments

### PCI DSS
- **Network Security**: Network isolation and segmentation
- **Access Control**: Strong authentication mechanisms
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.2+ for data in transit
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging

## Security Controls by Service

### Storage Accounts
- ✅ HTTPS-only traffic (enforced by default)
- ✅ Minimum TLS version 1.2
- ✅ Public blob access disabled by default
- ✅ Infrastructure encryption enabled
- ✅ Private endpoints support
- ✅ Network ACLs with deny-by-default
- ✅ Azure AD authentication preferred
- ✅ Soft delete and versioning enabled
- ✅ Advanced threat protection
- ✅ Customer-managed keys support
- ✅ Diagnostic logging enabled

### Key Vault
- ✅ Soft delete and purge protection
- ✅ Network ACLs with deny-by-default
- ✅ Private endpoints support
- ✅ RBAC authorization
- ✅ Diagnostic logging
- ✅ Key rotation policies

### SQL Database
- ✅ Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- ✅ Advanced threat protection
- ✅ Vulnerability assessments
- ✅ Private endpoints
- ✅ Azure AD authentication
- ✅ Audit logging

### App Service
- ✅ HTTPS only
- ✅ Minimum TLS version 1.2
- ✅ Managed identity
- ✅ Private endpoints
- ✅ Authentication/Authorization
- ✅ Diagnostic logging

## Security Scanning

### Pre-commit Hooks
All code must pass security scanning before commit:
- **Checkov**: Infrastructure as Code security scanning
- **tfsec**: Terraform static analysis
- **terraform fmt**: Code formatting
- **terraform validate**: Configuration validation

### CI/CD Pipeline Security
- Automated security scanning on every PR
- Security gate requirements before merge
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image scanning (if applicable)

### Custom Security Policies
We maintain custom security policies for organization-specific requirements:
- Required tags for compliance tracking
- Naming convention enforcement
- Region restrictions
- Service-specific policies

## Vulnerability Management

### Reporting Security Issues
Please report security vulnerabilities to: security@yourorganization.com

Do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Response Process
1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
3. **Remediation Plan**: Within 1 week
4. **Fix Deployment**: Based on severity
   - Critical: Within 24 hours
   - High: Within 1 week
   - Medium: Within 1 month
   - Low: Next release cycle

## Best Practices for Module Users

### 1. **Always Use Latest Versions**
```hcl
module "storage" {
  source  = "your-org/storage-account/azurerm"
  version = ">= 2.0.0" # Always use latest major version
  # ...
}
```

### 2. **Review Security Defaults**
Before overriding any security defaults, understand the implications:
```hcl
# ⚠️ WARNING: Only disable if you understand the security implications
shared_access_key_enabled = true  # Not recommended
```

### 3. **Enable All Monitoring**
```hcl
diagnostic_settings = {
  name                       = "security-logs"
  log_analytics_workspace_id = azurerm_log_analytics_workspace.main.id
  logs = [
    { category = "StorageRead" },
    { category = "StorageWrite" },
    { category = "StorageDelete" }
  ]
  metrics = [
    { category = "Transaction" }
  ]
}
```

### 4. **Use Private Endpoints**
```hcl
private_endpoints = {
  blob = {
    name                 = "storage-blob-pe"
    subnet_id            = azurerm_subnet.private.id
    private_dns_zone_ids = [azurerm_private_dns_zone.blob.id]
  }
}
```

### 5. **Implement Network Restrictions**
```hcl
network_rules = {
  default_action = "Deny"
  ip_rules       = ["203.0.113.0/24"] # Your organization's IPs
  bypass         = ["AzureServices"]
}
```

## Security Checklist for New Modules

When creating new modules, ensure:

- [ ] All resources have secure defaults
- [ ] Encryption at rest is enabled
- [ ] Encryption in transit is enforced (HTTPS/TLS 1.2+)
- [ ] Network access is restricted by default
- [ ] Private endpoint support is implemented
- [ ] Managed identity is preferred over keys
- [ ] Diagnostic settings are configurable
- [ ] Advanced threat protection is available
- [ ] All outputs mark sensitive data appropriately
- [ ] Security documentation is comprehensive
- [ ] Examples demonstrate secure configurations
- [ ] Tests validate security controls

## Continuous Improvement

Security is an ongoing process. We:
- Regularly review and update security policies
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities
- Update modules with latest security features
- Conduct periodic security audits
- Engage with the security community
