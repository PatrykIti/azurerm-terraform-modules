# 062 - 2026-01-28 - Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS) module

## Summary

Added a new Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS) module with scoped services,
diagnostic settings support, examples, and test coverage.

## Changes

- Added `modules/azurerm_monitor_private_link_scope` module scaffold and core
  implementation for AMPLS and scoped services.
- Implemented diagnostic settings integration and outputs for skipped
  configurations.
- Added examples (basic/complete/secure) and updated module documentation.
- Added unit tests and updated terratest fixtures for AMPLS scenarios.

## Impact

- Enables atomic management of AMPLS with standard patterns and secure defaults.
- Supports linking Log Analytics, Application Insights, DCE, or other resources
  as scoped services while keeping private endpoints and DNS out of scope.
