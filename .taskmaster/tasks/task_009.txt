# Task ID: 9
# Title: Virtual Network Module: Core Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Virtual Network module (`azurerm_virtual_network`). This module will manage VNet creation, address spaces, and the configuration of one or more subnets with associated Network Security Groups (NSGs).
# Details:
Create `modules/virtual_network`. The module should accept a variable for the main address space and a complex variable (e.g., a map of objects) for defining subnets. For each subnet, allow specifying its name, address prefix, and an option to create a default NSG. Use a `for_each` loop to create `azurerm_subnet` and `azurerm_network_security_group` resources based on the input map.

# Test Strategy:
Manually deploy the module with a configuration for a VNet and two subnets. Verify in the Azure portal that the VNet and subnets are created with the correct address prefixes and that the NSGs are associated correctly.
