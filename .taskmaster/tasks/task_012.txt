# Title: Key Vault Module: Terratest Suite and Examples
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive test suite for the Key Vault module using Terratest and develop corresponding usage examples.
# Details:
Create `test/key_vault_test.go`. Write Terratest cases to validate: 
1. Key Vault creation with correct SKU and security settings. 
2. Correct application of access policies. 
Use `azure.GetKeyVault` to assert properties. Create `examples/key_vault/simple` and `examples/key_vault/with_private_endpoint` to demonstrate different use cases.

# Test Strategy:
Execute the Terratest suite for the Key Vault module via the CI pipeline. All tests must pass, confirming resource creation and properties, followed by successful cleanup.
