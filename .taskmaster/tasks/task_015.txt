# Title: CI/CD Automation: Semantic Versioning and Release Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a GitHub Actions workflow for release management. The workflow will automate the process of tagging and releasing new module versions based on semantic versioning and conventional commits.
# Details:
Create a workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that triggers on pushes to the `main` branch. Use a tool like `go-semantic-release` or a custom script to: 
1. Analyze commit messages since the last tag (following Conventional Commits). 
2. Determine the next version number (patch, minor, or major). 
3. Create and push a new Git tag in the format `<module-name>/vX.Y.Z`. 
4. Create a GitHub Release with auto-generated release notes. 
This requires a strategy to identify which module was changed in a commit.

# Test Strategy:
Make a `feat:` commit to the Storage Account module on a feature branch and merge it to `main`. Verify that the release workflow triggers, creates a new tag (e.g., `storage_account/v1.0.0`), and publishes a corresponding GitHub Release.
