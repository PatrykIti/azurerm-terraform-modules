# Task ID: 19
# Title: Comprehensive Update of Storage Account Module Outputs
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct a comprehensive review and update of the `outputs.tf` file for the `azurerm_storage_account` module. This involves adding, correcting, and removing outputs for all associated resources to ensure all useful attributes are exposed.
# Details:
The goal is to align all outputs with the latest Terraform AzureRM provider documentation. Review the documentation for each of the following resources within the module: `azurerm_storage_account`, `azurerm_storage_container`, `azurerm_storage_queue`, `azurerm_storage_share`, `azurerm_storage_table`, `azurerm_private_endpoint`, `azurerm_storage_account_queue_properties`, `azurerm_storage_account_static_website`, `azurerm_storage_management_policy`, and `azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting`. For each resource, identify all exported attributes that provide value to the end-user. Add new `output` blocks for missing attributes, correct the `value` of any incorrect outputs, and remove any outputs that reference deprecated attributes. Ensure all outputs have a clear and concise `description`. For example, for `azurerm_storage_account`, ensure outputs like `primary_web_endpoint`, `primary_dfs_endpoint`, and the full `identity` block are exposed. For `azurerm_storage_container`, expose `id`, `name`, and `resource_manager_id`.

# Test Strategy:
1. Update the `complete` example in `examples/storage_account/complete` to include a local `outputs.tf` file that references all the newly added and updated outputs from the module. 2. Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` on this example to deploy the resources. 3. After a successful deployment, run `terraform output` and inspect the values to ensure they are not null or empty and appear correct. 4. Cross-reference at least five key output values (e.g., `primary_blob_endpoint`, a container ID, a private endpoint ID) with the actual resource properties in the Azure Portal to confirm accuracy. 5. Run `terraform destroy` and verify all resources are cleaned up successfully.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review and Update `azurerm_storage_account` Outputs [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct a thorough review of the `azurerm_storage_account` resource attributes against the official Terraform AzureRM provider documentation. Update the `outputs.tf` file to add, correct, or remove outputs to ensure all valuable attributes are exposed.
### Details:
1. Access the Terraform Registry page for the `azurerm_storage_account` resource.
2. Compile a list of all exported attributes.
3. Compare this list with the existing outputs in the module's `outputs.tf` file.
4. Add new `output` blocks for high-value missing attributes like `primary_web_endpoint`, `primary_dfs_endpoint`, `secondary_location`, and the `identity` block.
5. Correct the `value` of any outputs that are misconfigured.
6. Remove any outputs that reference deprecated attributes.
7. Ensure every output has a clear and concise `description`.

MANDATORY requirement: Before starting this subtask, review CLAUDE.md sections: important-instruction-reminders (lines 5-9) - especially "Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less" and "ALWAYS prefer editing existing files", and section 9: Terraform Best Practices Guide (lines 112-122) for module documentation standards. Key principles: Edit only outputs.tf file, do not create new files, ensure all outputs have clear descriptions.

## 2. Review and Update `azurerm_storage_container` Outputs [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the `azurerm_storage_container` resource attributes in the Terraform documentation. Update `outputs.tf` to expose useful attributes for all created containers, likely in a map format.
### Details:
1. Consult the `azurerm_storage_container` documentation on the Terraform Registry.
2. Since containers are created dynamically (likely via `for_each`), structure the output as a map keyed by the container name.
3. The output map should expose key attributes for each container, such as `id`, `name`, and `resource_manager_id`.
4. Implement the output like this: `output "containers" { description = "A map of storage containers." value = { for k, v in azurerm_storage_container.this : k => { id = v.id, name = v.name, resource_manager_id = v.resource_manager_id } } }`.
5. Ensure the output is created conditionally if container creation is optional.

### Details:
1. Check the `azurerm_storage_account_queue_properties` documentation on the Terraform Registry.
2. This resource primarily configures settings and may only export its `id`.
3. Determine if outputting the resource ID is useful for consumers of the module.
4. If so, add a new output: `output "queue_properties_id" { description = "The resource ID of the storage account queue properties." value = one(azurerm_storage_account_queue_properties.this[*].id) }`.
5. Use a conditional expression to handle cases where the resource is not created.

## 8. Review and Update `azurerm_storage_account_static_website` Outputs [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the `azurerm_storage_account_static_website` resource in the Terraform documentation. Ensure that related outputs on the main storage account resource are correctly exposed.
### Details:
1. Check the `azurerm_storage_account_static_website` documentation.
2. This resource enables static website hosting, but the primary endpoints (`primary_web_endpoint`, `primary_web_host`) are attributes of the `azurerm_storage_account` resource itself.
3. This task is to double-check that the outputs for `primary_web_endpoint` and `primary_web_host` are correctly implemented in `outputs.tf` as part of the `azurerm_storage_account` review.
4. Consider adding an output for the `azurerm_storage_account_static_website` resource `id` for completeness: `output "static_website_id" { ... }`.

2. The main exported attribute is the resource `id`.
3. Add an output to expose this ID, which is useful for auditing or creating dependencies.
4. Implement the output: `output "storage_management_policy_id" { description = "The resource ID of the storage management policy." value = one(azurerm_storage_management_policy.this[*].id) }`.
5. Use a conditional expression to handle cases where the resource is not created.
