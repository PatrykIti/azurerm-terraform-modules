# Task ID: 4
# Title: CI/CD Automation: terraform-docs Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Automate the generation of module documentation using terraform-docs. The CI/CD pipeline should update the README.md file within each module directory to reflect its inputs, outputs, and resources.
# Details:
Create a new GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`) or add a job to the existing one. Use an action like `terraform-docs/gh-actions@v1`. Configure it to read a `.terraform-docs.yml` config file in each module's directory. The action should generate the documentation and commit the changes back to the feature branch if updates are detected.

# Test Strategy:
Make a change to a module's `variables.tf` or `outputs.tf` file. Push the change to a PR branch. Verify that the GitHub Action automatically runs, generates updated documentation, and commits the new README.md to the branch.
