# Title: Standardize azurerm Provider Version to 4.35.0
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Pin the `azurerm` provider version to exactly `4.35.0` across all Terraform modules. This ensures consistent behavior and predictable deployments by preventing automatic provider upgrades.
# Details:
For each module in the `modules/` directory (e.g., `storage_account`, `virtual_network`, `key_vault`, `application_gateway`), locate or create a `versions.tf` file. Inside this file, add or update the `terraform` block to specify the exact provider version. The configuration should be: `terraform { required_providers { azurerm = { source = "hashicorp/azurerm", version = "= 4.35.0" } } }`. After updating the files, run `terraform init` within each module's primary example directory to update the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file. Commit both the changes to the `versions.tf` files and the updated lock file to the repository.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that every module directory under `modules/` contains a `versions.tf` file with the `azurerm` provider pinned to version `= 4.35.0`. 2. Pull the changes locally and run `terraform init` in at least two different module example directories (e.g., `examples/storage_account/simple` and `examples/application_gateway/simple_gateway`) to confirm successful initialization with the specified provider version. 3. Push the changes to a new branch and create a pull request. The CI/CD validation workflow must pass, confirming that `terraform validate` and `tflint` succeed for all modules with the pinned provider version.
