# Title: Storage Account Module: Terratest Suite and Examples
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive test suite for the Storage Account module using Terratest. Develop simple and complete usage examples in the `/examples` directory.
# Details:
In the `test/` directory, create `storage_account_test.go`. Write test cases using `t.Run` for different scenarios: 
1. A minimal deployment. 
2. A complex deployment with private endpoints and network rules. 
Use `terraform.InitAndApply` and `defer terraform.Destroy`. Use `azure.GetStorageAccount` from Terratest helpers to assert that the created resource has the correct properties. Create corresponding `examples/storage_account/simple` and `examples/storage_account/complete` directories with `main.tf` files demonstrating usage.

# Test Strategy:
Run `go test -v -timeout 15m ./...` from the `test/` directory. The GitHub Actions workflow for testing should execute this command against a test Azure subscription. All tests must pass, and resources must be successfully destroyed.
