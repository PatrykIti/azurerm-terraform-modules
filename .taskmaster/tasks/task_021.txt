# Task ID: 21
# Title: Parallel Validation of All Storage Account Module Examples
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a testing workflow to run `terraform init` and `terraform validate` in parallel across all storage account module examples. This task ensures all examples are syntactically correct and have their provider dependencies properly configured.
# Details:
Implement a GitHub Actions workflow that validates all 8 examples for the storage account module. The workflow should use a matrix strategy to run a separate, parallel job for each example directory. Each job must perform the following steps: 1. Check out the repository code. 2. Set up the specified version of Terraform. 3. Configure Azure credentials to allow the provider to initialize correctly. 4. Navigate into the specific example's directory (e.g., `examples/storage_account/simple`). 5. Execute `terraform init -backend=false` to initialize the provider and modules without configuring a state backend. 6. Execute `terraform validate` to check for syntax and configuration errors. Any validation errors discovered during implementation must be fixed. This includes correcting syntax, addressing provider version constraints, or fixing variable definitions within the example configurations. All fixes must adhere to the project's coding standards.

# Test Strategy:
1. Trigger the newly created GitHub Actions workflow by pushing a commit or creating a pull request. 2. Navigate to the 'Actions' tab in the GitHub repository and observe the workflow run. 3. Verify that a parallel job is initiated for each of the 8 storage account examples. 4. Confirm that each job successfully completes the `terraform init` and `terraform validate` steps with a green checkmark. 5. To ensure the failure condition works, intentionally introduce a syntax error into one of the example's `main.tf` files, push the change, and verify that the corresponding job in the workflow fails as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Validate and Fix the 'simple' Storage Account Example [pending]
### Dependencies: None
