# Title: CI/CD Foundation: Basic Validation Workflow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a foundational CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that triggers on pull requests. This workflow will perform basic validation checks on the Terraform code.
# Details:
Create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/validation.yml`). Use `actions/checkout@v4` and `hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3` with Terraform version `~> 1.8`. The workflow should have jobs for: 
1. `terraform fmt -check`: Checks formatting.
2. `terraform init`: Initializes the backend for validation.
3. `terraform validate`: Validates syntax. 
Set the workflow to trigger on `pull_request` events targeting the `main` branch.

# Test Strategy:
Create a pull request with a correctly formatted Terraform file. The action should pass. Create another PR with a formatting error; the action should fail on the format check.
