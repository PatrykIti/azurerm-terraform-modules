# Task ID: 11
# Title: Key Vault Module: Core Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Key Vault module (`azurerm_key_vault`). The module will handle Key Vault creation, access policies, SKU selection, and secure defaults like soft delete and purge protection.
# Details:
Create `modules/key_vault`. The `main.tf` should include the `azurerm_key_vault` resource. Implement secure defaults: `soft_delete_retention_days = 7` and `purge_protection_enabled = true`. Use a dynamic block to configure `access_policy` based on a list of object IDs. Include support for private endpoints and diagnostic settings, similar to the Storage Account module.

# Test Strategy:
Manually deploy the module. Verify in the Azure portal that the Key Vault is created with soft delete and purge protection enabled by default. Check that the specified access policies are correctly configured.
