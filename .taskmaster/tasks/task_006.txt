# Task ID: 6
# Title: Storage Account Module: Core Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the core Storage Account module (`azurerm_storage_account`) to comply with AzureRM provider v5.0. This involves replacing deprecated inline blocks with separate resources, updating variable structures, and ensuring all features like static websites, queue properties, and lifecycle rules are implemented using the latest best practices.
# Details:
Update the module to align with `azurerm` provider v5.0. Key changes include:
1. Removing the deprecated `static_website` and `queue_properties` blocks from the `azurerm_storage_account` resource.
2. Implementing these features using the new standalone resources: `azurerm_storage_account_static_website` and `azurerm_storage_account_queue_properties`.
3. Refactoring input variables (e.g., `static_website`, `queue_properties`) to be complex objects with empty object `{}` defaults, moving default values into `optional()` parameters.
4. Adding conditional creation logic for the new resources based on whether the corresponding input variable object is empty.

# Test Strategy:
Update and execute all existing examples (simple, complete, multi-region, secure, secure-private-endpoint) to validate the refactored module. Specifically verify:
1. Correct creation of the main storage account.
2. Conditional creation of the `azurerm_storage_account_static_website` and `azurerm_storage_account_queue_properties` resources.
3. Functionality of lifecycle rules, noting the incompatibility of the 'Archive' tier with ZRS accounts.
4. All outputs, including new ones for static website and corrected private endpoint references, are populated correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 2. Define Input Variables in `variables.tf` [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create the `variables.tf` file and define all the necessary input variables for the storage account module.
### Details:
In `modules/storage_account/variables.tf`, refactor all input variables to follow modern Terraform best practices. This includes defining complex object variables for `static_website` and `queue_properties` to control the new standalone resources. Set the default value for these optional configurations to an empty object `{}` and define nested attribute defaults using the `optional()` function.

## 3. Implement Input Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Add validation blocks to the input variables to enforce specific constraints and prevent misconfiguration.
### Details:
In `variables.tf`, add `validation` blocks to the `account_tier` and `account_replication_type` variables. The `account_tier` should only allow 'Standard' or 'Premium'. The `account_replication_type` should only allow valid Azure replication types (e.g., 'LRS', 'GRS', 'ZRS', 'RAGRS'). For complex object variables, validation is handled by their type constraints and `optional()` definitions.

## 4. Implement Core `azurerm_storage_account` Resource [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create the `main.tf` file and define the core `azurerm_storage_account` resource using the defined variables.
### Details:
In `modules/storage_account/main.tf`, update the `azurerm_storage_account` resource block. **Crucially, remove the deprecated `static_website` and `queue_properties` inline blocks.** Ensure all other arguments (`name`, `resource_group_name`, `location`, etc.) are correctly mapped from their input variables.

## 5. Configure Basic Blob Service Properties [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Enhance the storage account resource to support basic blob service configurations.
### Details:
In `main.tf`, add a `blob_properties` block to the `azurerm_storage_account` resource. Add a new optional variable to control the `delete_retention_policy` days for blobs.

## 6. Configure Basic File Share Properties [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Enhance the storage account resource to support basic file share service configurations.
### Details:
In `main.tf`, add a `share_properties` block to the `azurerm_storage_account` resource. Add a new optional variable to control the `delete_retention_policy` days for file shares.

## 7. Define Module Outputs in `outputs.tf` [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Create the `outputs.tf` file to expose key attributes of the created storage account for use by other modules.
### Details:
In `modules/storage_account/outputs.tf`, update and add outputs to reflect the new resources. Add outputs for the `azurerm_storage_account_static_website` (e.g., `static_website_endpoints`) and `azurerm_storage_account_queue_properties` resources. Ensure existing outputs like `primary_connection_string` (marked as sensitive) are preserved. Use `try()` for safe access to outputs from conditionally created resources.
